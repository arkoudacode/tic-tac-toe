# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Description

This is a tic-tac-toe game written in vanilla JavaScript. It is a two player game where each player takes turns placing their mark on the board. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

## Technologies Used

* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS

## Planning and Development Process

I started by creating a wireframe (HTML/CSS) of the game board and the game logic (JS). Then, I created a user story and a list of user stories. With user stories, I can have a better understanding how I would like to create the UX/UI and how to build out the game logic. Next, I created a list of tasks that I needed to complete to build the game. I put together a list of resources that I would need to complete the game. I also thought of a list of problems that I would need to solve to complete the game. Finally, I madeed a list of unsolved problems that I would need to add the game.

## User Stories

* Click on a square to place my mark.
* See my mark on the board.
* See my opponent's mark on the board.
* See a message that tells me if I won, lost, or tied.
* Start a new game.

## Unsolved Problems

* Allows the user to choose their mark (X or O).
* Allows the user to choose the size of the board.
* Allows the user to choose the number of marks in a row needed to win.
